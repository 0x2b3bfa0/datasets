{"coached_conv_pref": {"description": "A dataset consisting of 502 English dialogs with 12,000 annotated utterances between a user and an assistant discussing\nmovie preferences in natural language. It was collected using a Wizard-of-Oz methodology between two paid crowd-workers,\nwhere one worker plays the role of an 'assistant', while the other plays the role of a 'user'. The 'assistant' elicits\nthe 'user\u2019s' preferences about movies following a Coached Conversational Preference Elicitation (CCPE) method. The\nassistant asks questions designed to minimize the bias in the terminology the 'user' employs to convey his or her\npreferences as much as possible, and to obtain these preferences in natural language. Each dialog is annotated with\nentity mentions, preferences expressed about entities, descriptions of entities provided, and other statements of\nentities.", "citation": "@inproceedings{48414,\ntitle\t= {Coached Conversational Preference Elicitation: A Case Study in Understanding Movie Preferences},\nauthor\t= {Filip Radlinski and Krisztian Balog and Bill Byrne and Karthik Krishnamoorthi},\nyear\t= {2019},\nbooktitle\t= {Proceedings of the Annual SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://research.google/tools/datasets/coached-conversational-preference-elicitation/", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "features": {"conversationId": {"dtype": "string", "_type": "Value"}, "utterances": {"feature": {"index": {"dtype": "int32", "_type": "Value"}, "speaker": {"names": ["USER", "ASSISTANT"], "_type": "ClassLabel"}, "text": {"dtype": "string", "_type": "Value"}, "segments": {"feature": {"startIndex": {"dtype": "int32", "_type": "Value"}, "endIndex": {"dtype": "int32", "_type": "Value"}, "text": {"dtype": "string", "_type": "Value"}, "annotations": {"feature": {"annotationType": {"names": ["ENTITY_NAME", "ENTITY_PREFERENCE", "ENTITY_DESCRIPTION", "ENTITY_OTHER"], "_type": "ClassLabel"}, "entityType": {"names": ["MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY", "MOVIE_OR_SERIES", "PERSON", "SOMETHING_ELSE"], "_type": "ClassLabel"}}, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "builder_name": "coached_conv_pref", "config_name": "coached_conv_pref", "version": {"version_str": "1.1.0", "major": 1, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 2295579, "num_examples": 502, "dataset_name": "coached_conv_pref"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://storage.googleapis.com/dialog-data-corpus/CCPE-M-2019/data.json": {"num_bytes": 5191959, "checksum": "4ff051ea7ea60cf0f480c911c7e2cfed56434e2e2c9ea8965ac5e26365773f0a"}}, "download_size": 5191959, "dataset_size": 2295579, "size_in_bytes": 7487538}}
