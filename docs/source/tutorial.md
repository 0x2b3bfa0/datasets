# Overview

Welcome to the Datasets tutorial! ðŸ¤—

The goal of this tutorial is to help new users build up a basic understanding of Datasets. You will learn how to load a dataset, explore whats inside a Dataset object, use it with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and evaluate your model prediction's with a metric. After completing the tutorials, we hope you will have the necessary skills to start using Datasets for your own projects!

We understand that people who want to use Datasets come from a wide and diverse range of disciplines. The tutorials are designed to be as accessible as possible to people without a developer background. If you are a more experienced developer, take a look at our [Quick Start](../quickstart.rst) to see an end-to-end code example in context.
