Share
======

At Hugging Face, we are on a mission to democratize NLP and we believe in the significance of open source. That's why we designed Datasets so that anyone can share a dataset with the greater NLP community. There are currently over 900 datasets in over 100 languages, and the Hugging Face team always welcomes new submissions! ðŸ¤—

This guide will show you how to add a dataset that can be easily accessed by anyone in the community. The guide includes instructions for:

* how to add dataset metadata
* how to download data files
* how to generate samples
* how to upload a dataset to the Hub

Open the `SQuAD dataset loading script <https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/squad/squad.py>`_ template to follow along on how to share a dataset.

Add dataset attributes
----------------------

The first step is to add some information, or attributes, about your dataset with the :func:`datasets.DatasetBuilder._info` method. The most important attributes you should specify are:

1. :obj:`datasets.DatasetInfo.description` provides a concise description of your dataset that informs the user what's in the dataset, how it was collected, and how it can be used for a NLP task.

2. :obj:`datasets.DatasetInfo.features` defines the name and type of each column in your dataset. This will also provide the structure for each example, so you can create nested subfields in each column if you want. Take a look at the `reference <>`_ for a full list of feature types you can use.

    .. code-block::

        datasets.Features(
            {
                "id": datasets.Value("string"),
                "title": datasets.Value("string"),
                "context": datasets.Value("string"),
                "question": datasets.Value("string"),
                "answers": datasets.Sequence(
                    {
                        "text": datasets.Value("string"),
                        "answer_start": datasets.Value("int32"),
                    }
                ),
            }
        )

3. :obj:`datasets.DatasetInfo.homepage` contains a URL to the datasets homepage so users can find more about detailed information about it.

4. :obj:`datasets.DatasetInfo.citation` contains a BibTex citation for the dataset.

After you've filled out all these fields in the template, it should look like the following example from the SQuAD loading script:

.. code-block::

    def _info(self):
        return datasets.DatasetInfo(
            description=_DESCRIPTION,
            features=datasets.Features(
                {
                    "id": datasets.Value("string"),
                    "title": datasets.Value("string"),
                    "context": datasets.Value("string"),
                    "question": datasets.Value("string"),
                    "answers": datasets.features.Sequence(
                        {"text": datasets.Value("string"), "answer_start": datasets.Value("int32"),}
                    ),
                }
            ),
            # No default supervised_keys (as we have to pass both question
            # and context as input).
            supervised_keys=None,
            homepage="https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/",
            citation=_CITATION,
        )

Multiple configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, your dataset may have multiple configurations. For example, the `SuperGLUE <https://huggingface.co/datasets/super_glue>`_ dataset is a collection of 5 datasets designed to evaluate more difficult language understanding tasks. Datasets provides the :class:`datasets.BuilderConfig` that allows you to provide different configurations for the user to select from.

Let's study the `SuperGLUE loading script <https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/super_glue/super_glue.py>`_ to see how you can define several configurations.

1. Create a :class:`datasets.BuilderConfig` class with attributes about your dataset. These attributes can be the features of your dataset, label classes, and a URL to the data files.

    .. code-block::

        class SuperGlueConfig(datasets.BuilderConfig):
            """BuilderConfig for SuperGLUE."""

        def __init__(self, features, data_url, citation, url, label_classes=("False", "True"), **kwargs):
            """BuilderConfig for SuperGLUE.

            Args:
            features: `list[string]`, list of the features that will appear in the
                feature dict. Should not include "label".
            data_url: `string`, url to download the zip file from.
            citation: `string`, citation for the data set.
            url: `string`, url for information about the data set.
            label_classes: `list[string]`, the list of classes for the label if the
                label is present as a string. Non-string labels will be cast to either
                'False' or 'True'.
            **kwargs: keyword arguments forwarded to super.
            """
            # Version history:
            # 1.0.2: Fixed non-nondeterminism in ReCoRD.
            # 1.0.1: Change from the pre-release trial version of SuperGLUE (v1.9) to
            #        the full release (v2.0).
            # 1.0.0: S3 (new shuffling, sharding and slicing mechanism).
            # 0.0.2: Initial version.
            super(SuperGlueConfig, self).__init__(version=datasets.Version("1.0.2"), **kwargs)
            self.features = features
            self.label_classes = label_classes
            self.data_url = data_url
            self.citation = citation
            self.url = url

2. Add additional attributes to a configuration by sub-classing the base :class:`datasets.BuilderConfig`. This provides more flexibility for specifying the name and description of each configuration. These sub-classes should be listed under :obj:`datasets.DatasetBuilder.BUILDER_CONFIGS`:

    .. code-block::

        class SuperGlue(datasets.GeneratorBasedBuilder):
            """The SuperGLUE benchmark."""

            BUILDER_CONFIGS = [
                SuperGlueConfig(
                    name="boolq",
                    description=_BOOLQ_DESCRIPTION,
                    features=["question", "passage"],
                    data_url="https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/glue/superglue/data/v2/BoolQ.zip",
                    citation=_BOOLQ_CITATION,
                    url="https://github.com/google-research-datasets/boolean-questions",
                ),
                ...
                ...
                SuperGlueConfig(
                    name="axg",
                    description=_AXG_DESCRIPTION,
                    features=["premise", "hypothesis"],
                    label_classes=["entailment", "not_entailment"],
                    data_url="https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/glue/superglue/data/v2/AX-g.zip",
                    citation=_AXG_CITATION,
                    url="https://github.com/rudinger/winogender-schemas",
                ),
            ]

3. Now, users can load a specific configuration of the dataset with the configuration ``name``:

    .. code-block::

        from datasets import load_dataset
        dataset = load_dataset('super_glue', 'boolq')


Default configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users must specify a configuration name when they load a dataset with multiple configurations. Otherwise, a ``ValueError`` is raised and Datasets will prompt the user to select a configuration name. You can avoid this by setting a default dataset configuration with the :attr:`datasets.DatasetBuilder.DEFAULT_CONFIG_NAME` attribute:

.. code-block::

    class NewDataset(datasets.GeneratorBasedBuilder):

    VERSION = datasets.Version("1.1.0")

    BUILDER_CONFIGS = [
        datasets.BuilderConfig(name="first_domain", version=VERSION, description="This part of my dataset covers a first domain"),
        datasets.BuilderConfig(name="second_domain", version=VERSION, description="This part of my dataset covers a second domain"),
    ]

    DEFAULT_CONFIG_NAME = "first_domain"

.. tip::

    Only use a default configuration when it makes sense. Don't use it because it may be more convenient for the user to not specify a configuration when they load your dataset. For example, multi-lingual datasets often have a separate configuration for each language. An appropriate default may be an aggregated configuration that loads all the languages of the dataset if the user doesn't request a particular language.

Download data files and organize splits
---------------------------------------

After you've defined the metadata of your dataset, the next step is to download the data files and organize them according to their splits. 

1. Create a dictionary of URLs in the loading script that point to the original SQuAD data files:

    .. code-block::

        _URL = "https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/"
            _URLS = {
                "train": _URL + "train-v1.1.json",
                "dev": _URL + "dev-v1.1.json",
            }

2. The :obj:`datasets.DownloadManager.download_and_extract` method takes this dictionary and downloads the data files. Once the files are downloaded, :func:`datasets.SplitGenerator` organizes each split in the dataset. This is a simple class that contains:

    * The :obj:`name` of each split. You should use the standard split names: :obj:`datasets.Split.TRAIN`, :obj:`datasets.Split.TEST`, and :obj:`datasets.Split.VALIDATION`.

    * :obj:`gen_kwargs` provides the filepaths to the data files to load for each split.

Your :obj:`datasets.DatasetBuilder._split_generator()` should look like this now:

.. code-block::

    def _split_generators(self, dl_manager: datasets.DownloadManager) -> List[datasets.SplitGenerator]:
        urls_to_download = self._URLS
        downloaded_files = dl_manager.download_and_extract(urls_to_download)

        return [
            datasets.SplitGenerator(name=datasets.Split.TRAIN, gen_kwargs={"filepath": downloaded_files["train"]}),
            datasets.SplitGenerator(name=datasets.Split.VALIDATION, gen_kwargs={"filepath": downloaded_files["dev"]}),
        ]

Generate samples
----------------

So far you have added the dataset metadata, provided instructions for how to download the data files, and organized the splits. The next step is to actually generate the samples in each split. 

1. The :obj:`datasets.DatasetBuilder._generate_examples` method takes the filepath provided by :obj:`gen_kwargs` to read and parse the data files. You need to write a function that loads the data files and extracts the columns.

2. This should yield a tuple of an ``id_`` and an example from the dataset.

.. code-block::

    def _generate_examples(self, filepath):
    """This function returns the examples in the raw (text) form."""
    logger.info("generating examples from = %s", filepath)
    with open(filepath) as f:
        squad = json.load(f)
        for article in squad["data"]:
            title = article.get("title", "").strip()
            for paragraph in article["paragraphs"]:
                context = paragraph["context"].strip()
                for qa in paragraph["qas"]:
                    question = qa["question"].strip()
                    id_ = qa["id"]

                    answer_starts = [answer["answer_start"] for answer in qa["answers"]]
                    answers = [answer["text"].strip() for answer in qa["answers"]]

                    # Features currently used are "context", "question", and "answers".
                    # Others are extracted here for the ease of future expansions.
                    yield id_, {
                        "title": title,
                        "context": context,
                        "question": question,
                        "id": id_,
                        "answers": {"answer_start": answer_starts, "text": answers,},
                    }

Testing data and checksum metadata
----------------------------------

We strongly recommend adding testing data and checksum metadata to your dataset to verify and test its behavior. This ensures the generated dataset matches your expectations. This section will show you how to generate two files:

* ``dataset_infos.json`` stores the dataset metadata inclduing the data file checksums, and the number of examples required to confirm the dataset was properly generated.

* ``dummy_data`` is a file used to test the behavior of the loading script without having to download the full dataset.

.. important::

    Make sure you run all of the following commands **from the root** of your local ``datasets`` repository.

Dataset metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Run the following command to create the metadata file, ``dataset_infos.json``. This will also make sure your new dataset loading script works correctly.

    .. code-block::

        datasets-cli test datasets/<your-dataset-folder> --save_infos --all_configs

2. If your dataset loading script behaved normally, you should now have a ``dataset_infos.json`` file in your dataset folder. This file will contain information about the dataset like its ``features`` and ``download_size``.

Dummy data
^^^^^^^^^^

Next, you need to create some dummy data for automated testing. There are two methods for generating dummy data: automatically and manually. 

Automatic
"""""""""

If your data file is one of the following formats, then you can automatically generate the dummy data:

* txt
* csv
* tsv
* jsonl
* json
* xml

Run the command below to generate the dummy data:

.. code-block::

    datasets-cli dummy_data datasets/<your-dataset-folder> --auto_generate

Manual
""""""

If your data files are not among the supported formats, you will need to generate your dummy data manually. Run the command below which will output detailed instructions on how to create the dummy data:

.. code-block::

    datasets-cli dummy_data datasets/<your-dataset-folder>

    ==============================DUMMY DATA INSTRUCTIONS==============================
    - In order to create the dummy data for my-dataset, please go into the folder './datasets/my-dataset/dummy/1.1.0' with `cd ./datasets/my-dataset/dummy/1.1.0` .

    - Please create the following dummy data files 'dummy_data/TREC_10.label, dummy_data/train_5500.label' from the folder './datasets/my-dataset/dummy/1.1.0'

    - For each of the splits 'train, test', make sure that one or more of the dummy data files provide at least one example

    - If the method `_generate_examples(...)` includes multiple `open()` statements, you might have to create other files in addition to 'dummy_data/TREC_10.label, dummy_data/train_5500.label'. In this case please refer to the `_generate_examples(...)` method

    - After all dummy data files are created, they should be zipped recursively to 'dummy_data.zip' with the command `zip -r dummy_data.zip dummy_data/`

    - You can now delete the folder 'dummy_data' with the command `rm -r dummy_data`

    - To get the folder 'dummy_data' back for further changes to the dummy data, simply unzip dummy_data.zip with the command `unzip dummy_data.zip`

    - Make sure you have created the file 'dummy_data.zip' in './datasets/my-dataset/dummy/1.1.0'
    ===================================================================================

.. tip::

    Sometimes you may struggle with manually creating dummy data. Make sure you follow the instructions from the command ``datasets-cli dummy_data datasets/<your-dataset-folder>``. If you are still unable to succesfully generate your dummy data, open a `Pull Request <https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pulls>`_ and we will be happy to help you out!

Test
^^^^

The last step is to actually test dataset generation with the real and dummy data. Test the real data by:

.. code-block::

    RUN_SLOW=1 pytest tests/test_dataset_common.py::LocalDatasetTest::test_load_real_dataset_<your_dataset_name>

And to test the dummy data:

.. code-block::

    RUN_SLOW=1 pytest tests/test_dataset_common.py::LocalDatasetTest::test_load_dataset_all_configs_<your_dataset_name>

If both tests pass, your dataset was correctly generated! ðŸ¤—

Dataset card
------------

Each dataset should be accompanied with a Dataset card to promote responsible usage, and alert the user to any potential biases within the dataset. This idea is inspired by the Model Cards proposed by `Mitchell, 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993>`_. Dataset cards help users understand the contents of the dataset, context for how the dataset should be used, how it was created, and considerations for using the dataset. This guide shows you how to create your own Dataset card.

1. Create a new Dataset card by opening the `online card creator <https://huggingface.co/datasets/card-creator/>`_, or manually copying the template:

    .. code-block::

        cp ./templates/README.md ./datasets/<your_dataset_name>/README.md

2. Next, you need to generate the structured tags. These help users discover your dataset on the Hub. Create the tags with the `online tagging app <https://huggingface.co/datasets/tagging/>`_, or you can clone and install the `Dataset tagging app <https://github.com/huggingface/datasets-tagging>`_ locally.

3. Select the appropriate tags for your dataset from the dropdown menus.
