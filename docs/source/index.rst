Datasets is a library for easily accessing and sharing datasets, and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

Datasets provides the simplest and fastest way for users to download a dataset, and get it ready for training in a deep learning model. With built-in support for NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch and TensorFlow, Datasets ensures you can use it with a framework of your choice. We designed Datasets for speed and efficiency by using the Apache Arrow format, memory-mapping, multiprocessing, and smart caching. Datasets also supports sharing new datasets with the wider NLP community, making more resources available for training on different NLP tasks. There are currently over 900 datasets available, and in more than 100 languages.

Get started today and find your dataset on the `Datasets Hub <https://huggingface.co/datasets>`_, or take an in-depth look inside a dataset with the live `Datasets Viewer <https://huggingface.co/datasets/viewer/>`_.

Datasets and evaluation metrics for natural language processing

Compatible with NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch and TensorFlow

ðŸ¤— Datasets is a lightweight and extensible library to easily share and access datasets and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

ðŸ¤— Datasets has many interesting features (beside easy sharing and accessing datasets/metrics):

Built-in interoperability with Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch and Tensorflow 2
Lightweight and fast with a transparent and pythonic API
Strive on large datasets: ðŸ¤— Datasets naturally frees the user from RAM memory limitation, all datasets are memory-mapped on drive by default.
Smart caching: never wait for your data to process several times
ðŸ¤— Datasets currently provides access to ~100 NLP datasets and ~10 evaluation metrics and is designed to let the community easily add and share new datasets and evaluation metrics. You can browse the full set of datasets with the live ðŸ¤— Datasets viewer.

ðŸ¤— Datasets originated from a fork of the awesome TensorFlow Datasets and the HuggingFace team want to deeply thank the TensorFlow Datasets team for building this amazing library. More details on the differences between ðŸ¤— Datasets and `tfds` can be found in the section Main differences between ðŸ¤— Datasets and `tfds`.
