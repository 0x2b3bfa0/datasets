# Overview

Our how-to guides provide practical steps for solving a specific goal. These guides are intended to help you apply your knowledge of Datasets, and show you how to achieve a specific task. Want to flatten a column or load a dataset from a local file? We got you covered! You should already be familiar and comfortable with the Datasets basics, and if you aren't, we recommend reading our [tutorial](../tutorial.md) first.

The how-to guides will cover four key areas of Datasets:

* How to load a dataset from other sources of data, such as from in-memory data structures or local files.

* How to process the data with Dataset.

* How to manage the cache.

* How to upload and share a dataset with the wider NLP community.

You can also find guides on how to integrate with cloud storages, and even how to add an index to search your dataset.
