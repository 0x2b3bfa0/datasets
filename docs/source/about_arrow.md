# Datasets ü§ù Arrow

## What is Arrow?

Arrow enables large amounts of data to be processed and moved quickly. It is a specific data format that stores data in a columnar memory layout. This provides several significant advantages:

* Arrow's standard format allows zero copy reads which removes virtually all serialization overhead.
* Arrow is language-agnostic so it supports different programming languages.
* Arrow is column-oriented so it is faster at querying and processing data.
